Welcome to LetterCraft, a website that uses the power of natural language processing to automatically generate personalized cover letters from your resume.

Our website uses the OpenAI API to analyze your resume and extract important information, such as your work experience, skills, and education. This information is then used to generate a unique and professional-sounding cover letter that can be easily customized to fit the job you are applying for.

Our website is built using the Next.js framework, which allows us to render pages on the server and provide a fast and seamless user experience. We also use the React.js library to build our user interface and manage state in a modular and maintainable way.

To use our website, simply upload your resume in PDF format and let our algorithms do the rest. You can then preview and customize the generated cover letter to your liking, and download it as a PDF to attach to your job application.

We hope you find LetterCraft helpful and wish you the best of luck in your job search!
